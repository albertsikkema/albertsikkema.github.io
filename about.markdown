## Hello!   

I'm Albert Sikkema, a software engineer, managing consultant, and passionate problem solver with a diverse background spanning healthcare, social sciences, and technology. My journey has taken me from intensive care nursing to political science to software engineering, giving me a unique perspective on creating practical, user-friendly, and impactful digital solutions.   

## My Career Path 

I began my professional journey in healthcare, earning a degree in nursing, then specialized in intensive care. Over time, I developed a strong interest in data, technology and software development, recognizing how digital solutions could enhance processes and improve outcomes across industries.   

As my passion for coding and system architecture grew, I transitioned fully into the world of software engineering. Along the way, I completed a Master’s degree in Political Science, which sharpened my understanding of organizational structures, communication, and policy-making—skills that now help me bridge the gap between technology and business strategy.   

I currently serve as Lead Developer and Managing Consultant at ePublic Solutions, where I focus on building software for the public sector and healthcare. In my role, I not only develop cloud-driven applications, AI agents and data solutions but also contribute to the strategic growth of the company as we scale up.   

Additionally, I work as a freelance software developer through my independent venture, Sikkema Technical Solutions, delivering mobile and desktop applications for a variety of industries.

## My Interests 

I have a deep passion for AI, IoT, and emerging technologies, always seeking ways to push the boundaries of innovation. Outside of technology, I enjoy music, science fiction, and running, which keep me inspired and ready for new challenges.   

## Let's Connect 

I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Whether you're interested in discussing technology, innovation, or potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.

Looking forward to connecting!   

Albert Sikkema
