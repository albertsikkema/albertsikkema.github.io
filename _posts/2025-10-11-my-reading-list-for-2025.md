Now that I have a working ereader again (finally!), I can finally start tackling a long list of e-books I have collected. Here's what's queued up for the rest of 2025 and, let's be honest, probably well into 2026.

This post is primarily for myself—a convenient reference when I'm figuring out what to read next. But if it helps you discover a useful book or two, that's a nice bonus!
