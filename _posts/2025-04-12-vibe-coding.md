# Vibe Coding

I don’t know about you, but I keep seeing the term “vibe-coding” popping up everywhere lately. 

The concept? You give a Large Language Model a prompt like “I want to build an app,” and step by step, it spits out something that actually works.
Sounds a bit like magic, doesn’t it? 🧙 

And to be fair: it really can be an amazing productivity boost… if you know what you’re doing. 

But too often, I see vibe-coding projects that fall short when it comes to the basics: 

❌ Poor or missing security
❌ No version control or backups
❌ No testing
❌ No clear structure or best practices
❌ Hard-to-read, messy code
❌ And the time you saved? Usually lost fixing all the bugs later... 

Sometimes the code is even published online without a second thought — introducing a whole load of security and financial risks 😬 

Don’t get me wrong: I’m a huge fan of LLMs and AI tools. Honestly, I wouldn’t want to work without them anymore.
But jumping into vibe-coding without at least a basic understanding of software development? That’s asking for trouble. 

Want a little structure to go with the magic? 💪 

Stuck in an out-of-control vibe-coding session? Or have a cool idea but no clue where to start? 

Feel free to reach out! I’d love to help turn your idea into a solid, future-proof app. 🙌
