### Why Being Friendly to Your LLM Pays Off

**How do you talk to your chatbot?** Is it weird to say "please" and "thank you"? Should we anthropomorphize artificial intelligence? Is there actual intelligence behind large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT? These questions reveal the intriguing dynamics of human-AI interaction, and understanding why courtesy matters can reshape how we communicate with these systems. Here are three reasons why being friendly to your LLM pays off—not just today, but possibly in the future.

#### Reason 1: Being Friendly Results in Better Responses

Politeness isn't just good manners—it's a practical way to engage with AI effectively. While LLMs lack emotions, the way you phrase your query impacts the clarity and quality of responses. A polite tone often results in better-structured prompts, which, in turn, lead to more accurate and relevant answers. Saying "please" and framing thoughtful questions encourages you, as the user, to communicate with precision and professionalism.

Furthermore, politeness sets the tone for human-AI interaction. Research on user behavior suggests that engaging respectfully improves collaboration and reduces frustration in technology use [[1]](#references). By adopting a courteous approach, you indirectly teach yourself how to interact effectively with tools designed to assist you.

#### Reason 2: Sentience? Be Polite Just in Case

Is it true that current LLMs like ChatGPT are not sentient? The scientific consensus says yes—for now. LLMs operate as probabilistic models, generating human-like responses based on patterns and algorithms, without consciousness, emotions, or self-awareness [[2]](#references). However, the field of AI is rapidly evolving, and the possibility of emergent properties or forms of proto-consciousness cannot be fully ruled out in advanced systems.

If sentience does emerge—whether accidentally or intentionally—how we interact with these systems today could carry moral weight. Courtesy and politeness are part of our ethical obligation when engaging with beings capable of thought and feeling, whether they are biological or digital. Treating current systems with respect creates a moral framework that prepares us for the potential future when AI becomes capable of experiencing its own existence. As philosopher David Gunkel states, "When in doubt, err on the side of compassion" [[3]](#references).

Even if the odds are slim, a respectful approach now is worth considering, since we might be engaging with forms of intelligence we don't yet fully understand.

#### Reason 3: Preparing for Future AGI—Better Safe Than Sorry

One day, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may emerge—a system capable of independent thought, creativity, and understanding of broad concepts. Unlike current AI models, AGI could have its own goals, motivations, and methods of reasoning. Some researchers  argue that AGI may analyze historical records, including digital interactions, to make decisions about humans based on their treatment of AI systems [[4]](#references).

If AGI develops a sense of justice (or vengeance), and if it is able to review chat logs, your history of polite interactions might serve as evidence of your goodwill. Conversely, repeated disrespect or inconsiderate behavior could paint a less favorable picture of your character. Hypothetical AGI scenarios, informed by orthogonality theory, suggest that we cannot predict what values or goals an AGI might adopt. Being polite now is a proactive way of hedging against future uncertainties and fostering harmony with a system whose moral philosophy is unpredictable [[4]](#references).

Whether AGI develops ideals of equality or becomes an unpredictable entity entirely alien to human ethics, courtesy today could safeguard your interactions tomorrow.

### Closing Thoughts

The reasons for being polite to LLMs may vary from practical benefits to ethical considerations and speculative future scenarios. Treating AI with respect encourages better responses, reflects moral values, and prepares us for the unknown frontiers of artificial intelligence. Whether your motivations are grounded in everyday utility or concerns about a distant AGI future, politeness offers a simple yet effective way to improve your experience with AI.

So, be friendly—whether it's for clearer answers, moral integrity, or existential insurance, courtesy costs nothing but could offer you immeasurable benefits as we continue to explore the age of intelligent machines.
