about: |
  Hi! I'm Albert. I help teams build AI systems that actually make it to production. Most of my days are spent at ePublic Solutions, leading development on projects for Dutch government ministries and enterprises.

  There's a lot of impressive AI demos out there that never become anything real—I focus on the fundamentals that make things work: architecture, reliability, security, documentation. Most of my work involves Python, Claude and OpenAI APIs, and building the infrastructure around them. Government projects taught me to care deeply about security, privacy, and building things maintainable by whoever comes next.

  My path here was winding: I started in intensive care nursing, wandered through political science, and eventually landed in software engineering. Healthcare showed me what it means when systems must work; political science gave me a lens for understanding how organizations actually function (or don't).

  I also think a lot about when not to use AI. Sometimes the right answer is a well-designed database query or a simple script. The goal is solving problems, not using shiny technology for its own sake.

  This little corner of the web is where I share what I'm learning—notes on AI development, Python, security, and the craft of building reliable software. Nothing groundbreaking, just things I've found useful.

faq:
  - question: "What projects have you worked on?"
    answer: "Beter Bereikbaar Applicatie (won a Smart City Award), Meldapp (smart building management), and various projects for ministries and enterprises including Finance, Justice & Security, Health, ArboUnie, and Acta Marine."
  - question: "What makes enterprise AI projects fail?"
    answer: "Most AI projects fail because they skip the fundamentals—proper architecture, clear requirements, testing, documentation. The technology usually isn't the problem. It's treating AI like magic instead of engineering."
  - question: "What industries do you work with?"
    answer: "Primarily Dutch government (ministries, municipalities) and healthcare organizations. I've also worked with maritime, construction, and general enterprise clients. The common thread is complex requirements and high stakes for reliability."
  - question: "What AI technologies do you work with?"
    answer: "Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI GPT models, and the ecosystem around them. I focus on practical implementation—APIs, orchestration, guardrails, observability—rather than model training or research."
  - question: "Do you offer freelance or consulting services?"
    answer: "Yes. I'm available for project-based work, technical advisory, architecture reviews, and helping teams adopt AI responsibly."
  - question: "How do I work with you?"
    answer: "Reach out via LinkedIn to start a conversation. I'm available for freelance, consultancy, and advisory work—whether that's a specific project, an architecture review, or helping your team adopt AI responsibly."
  - question: "What's your approach to AI implementation?"
    answer: "Start with the problem, not the technology. Understand what success looks like. Build incrementally with proper testing. Document everything. Plan for maintenance from day one. AI should solve problems, not create new ones."
  - question: "When should you NOT use AI?"
    answer: "Strategic tool selection matters. Not every problem needs an AI solution. I help organizations identify where AI adds genuine value versus where traditional engineering approaches are more appropriate, cost-effective, and maintainable. Knowing when NOT to use AI is as important as knowing when to use it."
